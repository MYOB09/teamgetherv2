Teamgether sometimes launches new or redesigned parts of the Service that need some time to be tested and improved before they are offered as the “real deal” ("Beta Service"). The BETA label is displayed on such new Services to prove that it has been tested - it may not work for everyone. Most BETA Services are free, but some may need payment.

Use of the Beta Service is subject to these Terms and any additional terms that Teamgether may, in Teamgether’s sole discretion, specify from time to time.

Use of the Beta Service is only permitted for the period designated by Teamgether. Teamgether may terminate the Customer’s right to use the Beta Service at any time and for any reason at Teamgether's sole discretion, without any liability to the Customer.

Customer understands that any pre-releases and Beta Services are still under development, and therefore, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available products.

Teamgether makes no promises that any Beta Service will ever be made generally available.
